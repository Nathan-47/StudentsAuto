# Students Auto

This app was created to showcase my ability to use a react library (Material UI) to build a clean and modern user interface site. This app was a concept and wasd created to show users a variety of cars with specific infomration about said cars as if it was a car sales site such as AutoTrader but at a basic level.

## What I Learnt
Retrieving the JSON car information from the data.js file made it easier for me to get car information to the slider.js file without having to enter everything onto the file multiple times. I have used this way of retrieving data from JSON objects when I was building a blogging page thus knowing how to implement it to this app.

I would say using built in react bootstrap does makes things easier as there is minimal need to use CSS at times for the rows or columns etc. I do like how straight forward it is as well to use, the navbar is what I like the most about react bootstrap as it is a responsive navbar that only needs a few tweaks here and there but overall great to reduce time consumption. The con that I have learnt creating this app is the reliance on the library and not using my own ability to create some of the code. 

My main focus along with the car slider was on using Material-UI for a majority of the app to show I can use this library when needed. I believe that I now understand and can implement Material-UI into many more future react projects. Using this library did make making this app easier without many issues occurring. 

With react I enjoy that I can create my own database that are stored as objects in the data.js file. There is no process of having to use an API key to gain access to an online API site or mess with endpoints itâ€™s a simple call from the data.js file and use a const to call for the properties from the file array of the cars.
